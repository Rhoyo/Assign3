    <h2>Challenging aspects to this assignment?</h2>
    <p>The most challenging aspect was probably the navsearchbar.
    But mainly I had a problem with this because I did not know of
  the built in function indexOf in the beginning. I also had trouble
converting the nodes into strings but eventually I figured it out.</p>

  <h2>What did you learn from this assignment?</h2>
  <p>I learned a lot about the strings of JavaScript mainly that
  there are a lot more intuitive commands that can be run instead
of having to be created unlike C and C++. I found that I already knew
a lot thanks to my previous CS classes and this assignment appeared to
be a lot easier for me due to the more coding JavaScript is rather than
CSS and HTML.</p>

<h2>What resources were helpful in this assignment?</h2>
<p>the resources that were helpful were Stack Overflow and W3 Schools.
I also found it helpful to attend the lectures to get the general grasp
of JavaScript. I used the websites profusely however to determine certain
functions that we did not learn or get to in class.</p>

<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>
<p>I had to google indexOf to easily succeed to find the substring. Initially
I had thought I had to create a custom function to find a substring. However,
indexOf already does that. The others I did not really need to google as we
learned quite a bit of good resources during the lecture.</p>
